When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Keeping a remote repository allows for backup, easy collaboration for multiple people
on the same project and a public place accessible by other interested parties.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Automatically syncing between repositories would be counter-productive, since there would be changes in my local repository that I could
be working on, and an automatic pull could erase them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks is the concept of cloning a project internally on the servers of github. Clones is the same process between the servers
and a local computer. Finally, a branch is used when you want to deviate from the main project and experiment on some important
changes.
