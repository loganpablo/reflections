What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A git folder is created with the metadata for the files. It needs to be done so the directory can be created and populated later
with the files whose history I would like to track.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is a regular folder in which the git command line works. The staging area is an intermediate stage between the working
directory and the repository, which is the final destination of the files.
